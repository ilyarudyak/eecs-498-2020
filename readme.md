This is my solution of program assignments of [EECS498](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/teaching/eecs498/FA2020/) Fall 2020. 

The code is heavily commented. I also prepared some write-up files with additional comments and tips. See also my Medium posts: [cs231n vs. EECS 498](https://medium.com/@ilyarudyak/cs231n-vs-eecs-498-85536ae615) and [IoU: intersection over union](https://medium.com/@ilyarudyak/iou-intersection-over-union-in-pytorch-19636f716278).
